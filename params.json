  "body": "### Welcome to Web Automation using Selenium\r\nSelenium automates browsers, meaning it can mock user actions on browsers.\r\nIf you want to create robust, browser-based regression automation suites and tests, then you want to use Selenium (aka Selenium WebDriver); a collection of language specific bindings to drive a browser. It drives the browser directly using the browser’s built in support for automation.\r\n\r\nTo install Selenium means to set up a project in a development environment so you can write a program using Selenium. How you do this depends on your programming language and your development environment. The easiest way to set up a Selenium 2.0 Java project is to use Maven. Maven will download the java bindings (the Selenium 2.0 java client library) and all its dependencies, and will create the project for you, using a maven pom.xml (project configuration) file. Once you’ve done this, you can import the maven project into your preferred IDE, IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.\r\n\r\n### Framework Design\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Choosing different libraries\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Locators, Actions\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n",
